# Smart Parking System üöó

## Project Description
The Smart Parking System is an IoT-based solution that simplifies parking management in public spaces such as malls. This system leverages ultrasonic sensors, edge devices, and a centralized gateway to monitor and manage parking availability in real-time. The project is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience for both visitors and administrators.

## Features  ‚ú®
- **Real-Time Slot Monitoring**:
  - Displays the number of available parking slots.
  - Indicates slot status using green (available) and red (occupied) LEDs.
- **Entry and Exit Detection**:
  - Monitors car movement at entry and exit points.
  - Alerts when the parking lot is full using a buzzer.
- **Firebase Integration**:
  - Real-time data synchronization with Firebase Realtime Database.
  - Stores parking slot status and entry/exit activity.
- **LCD Display**:
  - Displays the number of available slots.
  - Shows "Parking Full" when all slots are occupied.
- **MQTT Communication**:
  - Facilitates communication between edge devices and the gateway.
  - Ensures efficient data transfer.

## Architecture üìä
The system consists of the following components:
1. **Edge Device 1 (Slots/Sensors)**:
   - Collects data from ultrasonic sensors for each parking slot.
   - Controls LEDs to indicate slot availability.
   - Sends data to the gateway via MQTT.
2. **Edge Device 2 (Gate)**:
   - Monitors entry and exit points using sensors.
   - Controls a buzzer to alert when slots are full.
   - Sends updates to the gateway via MQTT.
3. **Gateway**:
   - Acts as the central hub for data communication.
   - Updates Firebase with slot availability and gate activity.
   - Fetches slot data for display on the LCD screen.
4. **LCD Display**:
   - Provides real-time updates on parking slot availability.
5. **Firebase Realtime Database**:
   - Stores data for easy access and synchronization.
6. **MQTT Protocol**:
   - Ensures fast and reliable communication between devices.
